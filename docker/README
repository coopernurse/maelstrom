This docker image is used by the CI job.

It's derived from the standard golang docker image and adds the current
version of docker.  We link it to a docker-in-docker image via gitlab-ci.yml
and this allows the CI job to start/stop docker containers as required by
the tests.

This image will need to be updated whenever we want to move to a newer
version of Go.
